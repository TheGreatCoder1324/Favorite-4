I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was five years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a mystery story. I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my favourite author, Katerine Limbaugh and her husband who writes “ Rush Revere Series ” . There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me focused and calm. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too. I read chapter books often but when I read them I go for the whole day until its finished but thats sometimes. I read books by myself. I usually read it at home. I like to read many different books they always make me enjoyed!</p> </section> <section id="Favorite"> <h1>Favorite Books</h1> <div class="line"> </div> <iframe width="600" height="850" src="https://rushrevere.com/adventure-series-books/"> </iframe> </section> <section id="Work"> <h1> Work </h1> <div class = "line"> </div> <h1>I can Code!</h1> <iframe width="400" height="620" style="border: 0px;" src="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/Qe4_1MiAzGHJBVq7sI2HPbxIPf9JDtuX6tSoTQCLqp8/embed"></iframe> </section> <section id = "Inspiration"> <h1> My Inspiration </h1> <h1>Rush Limbaugh</h1> <div class = "line"> </div> <a class = "inspiration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh" target = "_blank"> <img src="RushLimbuagh.jpg" class = "Limbuagh"/></a> </section> </body></html>
